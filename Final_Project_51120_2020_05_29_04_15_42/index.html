        <h1 style="color: red" ;="">  Robot Final Project </h1> 
<p style="color: white" ;=""> This sketch was one of the first ones I've ever did on p5, and throughout the year I have made various edits and changes to it. Create Computation has really been an enjoyable class for me this year, and I thought it would be nice to continue this theme for my last project. And, of course, I used my iconic creative comp project song hehe!
